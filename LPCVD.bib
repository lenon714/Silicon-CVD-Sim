	abstract = {The high photoelectric conversion efficiency of tunnel oxide passivating contacts ({TOPCon}) photovoltaic ({PV}) cells and their process compatibility are increasingly recognized by the industry, making it of growing importance to develop deposition process technologies for high-capacity polysilicon thin films. Currently, the size of {LPCVD} reactors for preparing polysilicon thin films in the industry is getting enlarged, which directly leads to the degradation of axial uniformity of polysilicon thin films. In this paper, a coupled multi-physics field model is established to simulate the polysilicon thin-film Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition ({LPCVD}) process based on {COMSOL} Multiphysics platform, and the validity of the model is verified by comparing experimental data with simulation results. By investigating the flow field, thermal field, chemical reaction field and surface reaction field, the effects of the process parameters such as chamber temperature and pressure are investigated, as well as characteristics of the polysilicon thin films deposition. The results show that the uniformity of thin films decreases with increasing temperature and pressure, and the deposition rate of thin films increases as temperature and pressure increase. With the help of optimized the process parameters, the deposition rate of polysilicon thin films was increased by 13.0\% and the uniformity of thin films was controlled above 96\%. The uniformity of the films can be further improved to 96.7\% by optimizing the temperature zone parameters and adopting the wafers placement strategy.},

	abstract = {A new vertical parallel-flow, hot-wall, multiple-wafer reactor has been developed for silicon low pressure chemical vapour deposition ({LPCVD}). It is an annular reactor with a large isothermal zone in which the wafers take place. A two-dimensional mathematical model has been elaborated for fluid dynamic and mass transfer simulations with both gaseous phase and solid interface reactions. This model has been used to simulate silicon deposition on square wafers, for various operating conditions, i.e., pressures, temperatures, reactant gas concentrations and inter wafers distances. It has been observed that, in comparison with that of conventional horizontal {LPCVD} reactors, the production of silylene ({SiH}2) radicals in the homogeneous phase, due to larger forced convection phenomenon in the inter wafer space, plays a more important role on the silicon deposition rate on substrate surfaces.},
